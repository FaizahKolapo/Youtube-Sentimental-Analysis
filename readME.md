# Youtube Sentimental Analysis Web App
This is a simple web application that performs sentiment analysis on youtube video comments. The sentiment analysis is performed using the naive Bayes algorithm from the TextBlob library in Python. The app is built using Flask, a web framework for Python. The app is deployed on PythonAnywhere.

## How to use the app
You can access the deployed app at http://faizahk.pythonanywhere.com/.

To use the app, simply enter a youtube video id in the input field and click on the "View sentiment" button. The app will then analyze the sentiment of the video and display the result in percentages as either "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".

## Future Improvements
Some potential improvements for the app are:
- Improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis by using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm or a pre-trained model.
- Add a feature to analyze the sentiment of multiple texts at once.
- Improve the UI of the app to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
